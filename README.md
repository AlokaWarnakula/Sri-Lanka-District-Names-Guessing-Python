# Sri Lanka District Guessing Game

Welcome to the Sri Lanka District Guessing Game! This interactive game challenges you to name all the districts of Sri Lanka by clicking on the map. Test your knowledge and have fun exploring the geographical layout of Sri Lanka!

## How the Game Works

- The game displays a map of Sri Lanka.
- You are prompted to guess the name of a district.
- If your guess is correct, the district's name appears on the map at its location.
- If your guess is incorrect, a message indicates the district was not found.
- The game continues until all districts are correctly guessed.

## Acknowledgements

ðŸ“š This project was inspired by core game mechanics outlined in a Python programming course. While the basic concept and requirements were provided by the course, I independently implemented the game to enhance my understanding of Python, turtle graphics, and data handling.

I truly enjoyed creating this project, and I hope you find it fun and educational! Feel free to modify and expand upon it.
